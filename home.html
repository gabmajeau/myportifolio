        My function in this project its developer the frontend, where i used HTML5, CSS and
        JavaScript to made the Login page and the home page, 100% functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app allows users to submit photos and detailed information about
        sneakers, which are then analyzed and, if approved, receive a digital
        certificate. This certification is recorded on a blockchain, ensuring
        authenticity, security, and traceability.

        This is a simple project developed for training purposes. It replicates the Instagram login page using only HTML

      <p>I made this portfolio from scratch, using only html and css, my idea was to make a site with a "dead" theme and
        that when stimulated, it would react! Feel free to use the code and change it the way you want, my goal is to collaborate with the community that
        collaborates with us so much.
      </p>
      <p>I hope i was able to achieve my goal!</p>

      table</a>
    <p>
      I participated of a the project to build a visual and motor stimulation
      table for disabled children at<a href="https://www.adefip.org.br/" target="_blank">
        <b> ADEFIP </b></a>(Association of Physically Disabled People of Poços de Caldas) in Poços
      de Caldas, and I can say that it was an incredible experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When activated by means of colored buttons, the table turns on lamps of
      the same color, offering valuable sensory interaction and promoting
      learning in a fun and inclusive way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table has an internal Arduino UNO and was made with basic
      programming, the biggest work was the infrastructure, where relays and
      small transformers were needed.

    <article>
      <p>
        I born in a small city in Brazil, not a bad city, very pretty, actually. When i complete 18 years old, i go directly search
        a job, at first, in admnistrative area, and i hated, computer awalys be one of my passions! And occasionally, i got a
        work in a university of the city, and this change my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work in the university, called <a href="https://www.pucpcaldas.br/" target="_blank"><i>PUC
          Minas</i></a>, give me the opportunity to study by free! And here i start my jorney at the Computer Cience,
        and honestly, at first, i was startled, i felt lost, but when i met frontend programming, a small flame lit
        inside me, maybe that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a enthusiast technology and a Computer Science student determined to explore the countless
        possibilites in
        the world of technology and intend to continue with the mission of becoming a good frontend developer, always
        delving deeper into
        subjects involving the area.
      </p>
      <p> Really, realy hope you enjoy!</p>
